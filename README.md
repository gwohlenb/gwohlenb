Hello!

I have spent much of my career as a dev manager and technical program manager. But I've never lost the desire to continue learning new things.

My original inspiration was programming simple video games on the Commodore 64 using MOS 6510 assembler. It ran at the blazing speed of 1 MHz but was more than enough to help me understand the magic of how a small computer works.

Later in the university setting I did a lot of assembler on the MC6800, 6810, 68HC11 and MC68000/10/20. And of course learned the programming languages of that era including C, Pascal, PL-1, Prolog, Lisp and others. My master's thesis was related to early concepts for visual programming languages.

In the professional setting I focused on C and C++ in the embedded system arena, but also did some Windows Server programming. I worked with a team doing cfront-based C++ before it was even considered sane. I later added networking, security and HA skills.

Currently, I like programming in Go and containerized stuff deployed with Kubernetes. On the professional side I am more weighted towards today's devops tools in a Linux environment. But on the hobby side I enjoy experimenting with Node, Go and Python for home automation, network programming and general problem solving. I also like web programming with PHP, Bootstrap, and a bit of Java/Typescript. But it never ends...I am interested in learning Rust next.
